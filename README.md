Baby Names
==========

Grabbing data to help making picking baby names less painful.

Currently just dumps out a lot of names into some CSV files:

- us-names.csv = all US names, with a heading and gender column
- us-names-female.csv = US names with `F` gender
- us-names-male.csv = US names with `M` gender
